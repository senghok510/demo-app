# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply/remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

When enabled, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues using the corresponding `gh pr` commands.

## When a skill says “publish to the issue tracker”

## When a skill says “fetch the relevant ticket”

## Wayfinding operations

The `$wayfinder` map is one GitHub issue with child issues as tickets.

- Map label: `wayfinder:map`

- Prefer GitHub sub-issues and native issue dependencies.
- If unavailable, use task lists and `Blocked by: #<number>` lines.
- Claim with `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me`.
- Resolve by commenting with the answer and closing the issue.
